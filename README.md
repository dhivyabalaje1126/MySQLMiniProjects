# MySQLMiniProjects
This space will coontain small mini-projects I've given myself in SQL. I will mostly be coding in MySQL. These projects are purely for my own learning and experimentation.

Projects in here
1. Analysis of the 'country' table of the 'world' database (automatically installed in every Full Installation of MySQL).
   This is just me trying out various functions and methods to extract info from the country table.
2. Practicing coding in SQL in MySQL database by analyzing the sakila database a bit.
   This is a smaller project, more for my own practice than for any kind of analysis.
